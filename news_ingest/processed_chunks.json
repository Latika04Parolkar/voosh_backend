He resigned as a ministerial aide in 2014, after being accused of paying for sex from a male sex worker, allegations which he denied at the time.\nMenzies's political career ended in April last year after a newspaper report revealed that he had been accused of misusing campaign funds given by local donors in his constituency.\nThe money had been paid to a \"business group\", with a bank account set up and administered by Ms Fieldhouse and another local Conservative volunteer.\nIn December 2023, he called Ms Fieldhouse at 3am, waking her from her sleep and asking her to send him thousands of pounds of the donated money.",

She was subsequently reimbursed from the campaign fund.\nAfter meeting the MP at the flat, the male aide said he accompanied Menzies and two sex workers to a nearby bank, waiting in a neighbouring cafe while the politician withdrew cash.\nMenzies's alleged efforts to repay the male aide led to an investigation by Ipsa, the expenses watchdog.",

A criminal investigation is under way.\nJLR has dismissed reports that the operational impact of the attack may continue for weeks or months as \"speculation\".\nBut concerns are growing about the impact of the stoppage on the carmaker's extensive supply chain, amid claims some companies could face bankruptcy without prompt financial support.\nThe shutdown is believed to be costing the company at least £50m a week in lost production.

    "text": "Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has told suppliers that production at its factories will not resume until 24 September at the earliest following a serious cyber attack, but industry sources have warned disruption could last into November.\nThe hack, which occurred more than two weeks ago, forced JLR to shut down its IT networks and paralysed production. A criminal investigation is under way.\nJLR has dismissed reports that the operational impact of the attack may continue for weeks or months as \"speculation\".\nBut concerns are growing about the impact of the stoppage on the carmaker's extensive supply chain, amid claims some companies could face bankruptcy without prompt financial support.\nThe shutdown is believed to be costing the company at least £50m a week in lost production. JLR would normally expect to build more than 1,000 cars a day.\nThe firm, which is owned by India's Tata Motors, has car plants in Solihull and Halewood, as well as an engine facility in Wolverhampton.\nIt also has large factories in Slovakia and China, as well as a smaller facility in India. \nBut all of the production lines have been at a standstill since 1 September when the hack first came to light.",

We cannot comment further, as a non-disclosure provision is in effect.\n\"No UAF official, staff, doctors, or coach were involved.\"\nUAF president and former Chelsea striker Andriy Shevchenko has not visited him at any point, although he also maintains a residence in London.\nIt remains unclear how exactly Mudryk apparently ingested meldonium, which has been banned by Wada since 2016 and is primarily used in Eastern European countries to treat conditions such as angina, heart failure, and coronary artery disease.\nTests at the 2015 European Games in Baku found that 13 medallists were taking the substance at the time, and that its use occurred in the majority of the sports included in the Games.\nWimbledon champion Maria Sharapova failed a drugs test in March 2016 after meldonium was detected in her sample.\nWhat is meldonium and can it enhance a footballer's performance?",

    "text": "During the most recent international break, Ukraine's national team lost at home to France and drew away with Azerbaijan, meaning they risk missing out on qualification for the World Cup in 2026. \nTherefore, the absence of Mudryk has led to frustration and intrigue in the country.\nHis former club Shakhtar Donetsk stand to lose a potential €30m (£26m) in add-ons, which were agreed by Chelsea in addition to the upfront transfer fee.\nThe conditions for those fees are likely to never be fulfilled with Mudryk unable to play, but reports in Ukraine suggesting Shakhtar are considering suing the UAF over the potential lost earnings were described as \"nonsense\" by the club's CEO Sergei Palkin, and the club insists finances are not its primary concern.\n\"When we speak about Mudryk, we don't think about the money, we speak about the human being,\" the club's sporting director Dario Srna told BBC Sport. \n\"We feel so sorry for him. We know he is 100% innocent - he will show that.  \n\"We support him like an ex-player, a human being and a friend. We don't think the money is important.\"",

It is about us securing a foothold as the primary symbolic and strategic ally of the United States.\"\nFor all these potential gains, the risks are huge and the most obvious involves, of course, Lord Mandelson.\nThe peer's dismissal as ambassador, after revelations of the scale of his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein following Epstein's conviction as a paedophile, means the press conference at Chequers on Thursday will not be dominated by questions about his future.\nInstead, the prime minister will likely be asked why he appointed the peer in the first place and why he took so long to sack him; what did he know and when?",

Their squad is among the strongest in European football.\nSteve Wilson: I like the look of Chelsea, but obviously Liverpool will strongly fancy their chances.\nStephen Warnock: Chelsea are my surprise package, but Liverpool will go the furthest of the Premier League sides.\nSteph Houghton: I see Liverpool as having the squad depth to be able to compete in all competitions. Their signings have added real quality to an already strong squad.\nMatt Upson: For similar reasons to why I think Barca will win it, I think Arsenal will do the best of the English teams. The core of their team is still together, they have strengthened their squad and they are also another big European campaign further along. They can use a run like the one they had last season in order to be even more successful.\nPat Nevin: I am certain Arsenal have got that depth you need to go far in this competition.",

They are back in the Champions League for the first time since 2015 and their manager Ernesto Valverde has done a phenomenal job.

Always difficult to beat in Naples, now with the added nous of Kevin de Bruyne to add to the wily ways of coach Antonio Conte.\nSteph Houghton: De Bruyne brings class, experience and something special to Napoli.

Their squad depth is excellent, the quality was already there and now they have got Isak up front as well.\nBBC Radio 5 Live football correspondent John Murray: When a team wins Europe's richest league at a comparative canter then spends the best part of half a billion pounds on new players, while at the same time securing the services of two of the club's greatest servants, it's difficult to tip anyone other than Liverpool.",

It would be a tremendous prospect if this season Liverpool and PSG were to make it all the way to the final in Budapest.\nMatch of the Day commentator Steve Wilson: Tipping Real Madrid to win the Champions League is hardly the work of a soothsayer, but you are not likely to be far wrong. I thought Xabi Alonso did some interesting things with his squad in the Club World Cup - and getting Arda Guler more involved can only be a good thing. \nHis progress was held back by the affection everyone at the Bernabeu had for Luka Modric, now he has licence to really spread his wings.\nThe Observer football correspondent Rory Smith: It's been a frankly unacceptable one season since Real Madrid won the trophy the club sees as its birthright, and Alonso's main task as manager is to put that right. Real are never the most coherent team in Europe, but they have more individual talent than anyone, and often that is what matters.",

I thought Xabi Alonso did some interesting things with his squad in the Club World Cup - and getting Arda Guler more involved can only be a good thing. \nHis progress was held back by the affection everyone at the Bernabeu had for Luka Modric, now he has licence to really spread his wings.\nThe Observer football correspondent Rory Smith: It's been a frankly unacceptable one season since Real Madrid won the trophy the club sees as its birthright, and Alonso's main task as manager is to put that right. Real are never the most coherent team in Europe, but they have more individual talent than anyone, and often that is what matters.",

He is a ridiculous talent and I love watching him play.\nYamal's first goal for Barcelona in the first leg of their semi-final against Inter made him the youngest scorer in a Champions League semi-final - aged 17 years and 291 days - breaking Kylian Mbappe's record of 18 years and 140 days set in 2017\nJohn Murray: The player I'm looking forward to watching is Yamal as I am yet to commentate on him in a Barcelona shirt. \nWhile disappointingly it looks like he might not be fit for Thursday at St James' Park, I suspect there will be other opportunities as this Champions League progresses.",

Destined to be one of, if not the, best footballers in the world.\nSteph Houghton: Yamal is a global superstar. I'm excited to see how he performs against teams that are more than likely going to double up against him.\nNicky Bandini: We're all itching to see more of Yamal, aren't we? The two legs of Barcelona's semi-final against Inter last season will stay with me for a very long time. Maybe it's unfair to ask an 18-year-old what he can do for an encore, but you can't help but be excited at the prospect.\nThere are plenty of others I'm excited to watch too though! Of course we're all curious about Max Dowman after he made his debut for Arsenal at 15, and it'll be fun to see Scott McTominay in the Champions League with Napoli after he fired them to a domestic title last season and was named  Serie A's Most Valuable Player.",

    "text": "A triathlete is ready to face life with no limbs after they were all amputated as she fought sepsis.\nCardiff University medical student Lily McGarry, from Jersey, believed she was experiencing a bout of \"freshers' flu\".\nBut after being taken to hospital, the 24-year-old suffered two heart attacks and fell into a coma, with the next three months a complete blank. \nThe life-threatening condition, where the body's response to an infection damages tissues and organs is not yet clearly understood and can affect anyone, of any age, according to the UK Sepsis Trust. \n\"When you're young you think, as I did, that these kind of conditions don't affect you,\" said Lily. \n\"You feel a bit invincible, and you don't want to worry about your health because you've got a social life to live.\"\nDescribed by her friends as \"a fantastic sportswoman\", Lily was passionate about swimming, running and being at the beach. \nBut as she lies in her bed at Cardiff's Llandough Hospital, she remembers the day her normal student lifestyle was turned upside down, and contemplates how she can return to an active lifestyle.",
